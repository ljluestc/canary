# Product Requirements Document: Blue-Green and Canary Deployment System

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
This project implements a production-ready GitOps deployment system using ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts to enable blue-green and canary deployment strategies on Kubernetes. The system provides safe, controlled application rollouts with automated rollback capabilities.

### 1.2 Business Objectives
- Reduce deployment risk by enabling zero-downtime deployments
- Provide instant rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Enable gradual traffic shifting for canary releases
- Implement GitOps principles for infrastructure and application management
- Provide observability and monitoring throughout deployment lifecycle

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- Zero-downtime deployments achieved
- Rollback time < 30 seconds
- Support for concurrent blue-green environments
- Canary deployments with configurable traffic split (1%, 10%, 50%, 100%)
- Full GitOps workflow implemented

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components
1. **Kubernetes Cluster** (kind-based single node)
   - Container runtime for all services
   - Ingress-nginx for traffic routing
   - Support for multiple namespaces

2. **ArgoCD**
   - GitOps continuous delivery tool
   - Manages application deployments from Git
   - Provides UI for deployment visualization
   - Auto-sync capabilities

3. **Argo Rollouts**
   - Progressive delivery controller
   - Blue-green strategy implementation
   - Canary strategy implementation
   - Traffic management and analysis

4. **Prometheus**
   - Metrics collection
   - Rollout analysis
   - Performance monitoring

5. **Ingress Controller**
   - Traffic routing between active/preview services
   - Host-based routing for blue-green
   - Weighted traffic splitting for canary

### 2.2 Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Active Service**: Serves production traffic at `http://blue-green.local`
- **Preview Service**: New version available at `http://blue-green-preview.local`
- **Promotion**: Instant switchover from old to new version
- **Rollback**: Instant revert to previous version

#### Canary Deployment
- **Baseline**: Current production version (stable)
- **Canary**: New version receiving percentage of traffic
- **Progressive Rollout**:
  - Step 1: 10% traffic to canary
  - Step 2: 25% traffic to canary
  - Step 3: 50% traffic to canary
  - Step 4: 75% traffic to canary
  - Step 5: 100% traffic to canary (promotion)
- **Automated Analysis**: Metrics-based promotion/rollback decisions
- **Manual Gates**: Optional approval steps

## 10. Deployment Workflow

### 10.1 Blue-Green Deployment Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to Git
2. CI builds and pushes new container image
3. Developer updates Helm values with new image tag
4. ArgoCD detects change and syncs
5. Argo Rollouts creates new ReplicaSet (preview)
6. New pods start and pass health checks
7. Preview available at preview URL
8. Operator tests preview environment
9. Operator promotes rollout (manual)
10. Active service switches to new ReplicaSet
11. Old ReplicaSet scaled down after delay

### 10.2 Canary Deployment Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to Git
2. CI builds and pushes new container image
3. Developer updates Helm values with new image tag
4. ArgoCD detects change and syncs
5. Argo Rollouts creates new ReplicaSet (canary)
6. Traffic gradually shifts: 10% → 25% → 50% → 75%
7. Analysis runs at each step
8. If metrics are healthy, promote to next step
9. If metrics are unhealthy, automatically rollback
10. At 100%, canary becomes stable version
11. Old ReplicaSet scaled down

## 11. Monitoring & Alerts

### 11.1 Key Metrics
- Rollout status (Healthy/Progressing/Degraded/Paused)
- Active replica count
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Request rate (RPS)
- Pod CPU/Memory usage
- Pod restart count

### 11.2 Alert Conditions
- Rollout degraded for > 5 minutes
- Error rate > 5% during canary
- Latency p95 > 2x baseline during canary
- Pod crash loop backoff
- ArgoCD out of sync for > 10 minutes

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

### 12.1 Risks
1. **Risk**: Configuration drift between Git and cluster
   - **Mitigation**: ArgoCD auto-sync enabled, drift detection alerts

2. **Risk**: Incorrect traffic split causing production impact
   - **Mitigation**: Start with low percentages, automated rollback

3. **Risk**: Analysis metrics unavailable or incorrect
   - **Mitigation**: Default to manual promotion, validate metrics first

4. **Risk**: Cluster resource exhaustion during rollout
   - **Mitigation**: Resource limits, quotas, maxSurge controls

5. **Risk**: Database schema incompatibility between versions
   - **Mitigation**: Blue-green better for breaking changes, schema versioning

### 12.2 Rollback Strategy
- Automated rollback on failed health checks
- Automated rollback on failed analysis
- Manual rollback via ArgoCD UI or CLI
- Git revert for source-level rollback
