## 8. Risk Management

### 8.1 Risks
1. **Risk**: 100% coverage may be difficult for some edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Use coverage exemptions judiciously with # pragma: no cover

2. **Risk**: Integration tests may be flaky
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper test isolation, cleanup, and retries

3. **Risk**: CI/CD pipeline may be slow
   - **Mitigation**: Parallelize tests, use caching, optimize test execution

4. **Risk**: Race conditions may be hard to reproduce
   - **Mitigation**: Use stress testing, run tests multiple times

5. **Risk**: Missing systems may have unclear requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Research similar systems, create reasonable implementations

## 9. Metrics and KPIs
